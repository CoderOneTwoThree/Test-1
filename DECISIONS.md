# Architecture Decisions

## Product
1. Who is the primary user persona for this architecture, and what is their top success metric?
2. What is the minimum feature set required for a viable first release?

## Data
3. What are the authoritative data sources and their update/refresh cadence?
4. What data retention and deletion policies must the system enforce?

## Progression logic
5. What criteria determine when a user advances to the next stage?
6. How should the system handle regressions or setbacks in user progress?

## Plan generation
7. What inputs (constraints, preferences, goals) are required to generate a plan?
8. How should the system prioritize or rank candidate plan steps?

## Non-functional
9. What are the target performance and scalability requirements (latency, throughput, concurrency)?
10. What security and privacy controls (auth, access, encryption) are mandatory?
