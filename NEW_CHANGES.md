# Review Findings: Actionable Steps

## Blocking
1. Add a default starting-weight rule for exercise swaps (empty history) so users receive a safe initial load recommendation.
2. Add equipment increment handling so rounding respects the user’s smallest available increment (e.g., 10 lb plates or fixed dumbbell jumps).

## Advisory
1. Make equipment a required question in the UX flow, or define a safe default equipment set (e.g., bodyweight-only) when skipped.
