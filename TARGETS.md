# Lift Targets

- Use 3 working sets per lift unless stated otherwise.
- Use a rep range of 6–12 reps for each working set.
- Select a starting weight you can lift for 6 reps with 2–3 reps in reserve (RIR).
- Target 12 reps on the first set and accept no fewer than 10 reps on the last set; increase weight only when both are achieved with 1–2 RIR.
- When increasing weight, round down to the smallest available increment for feasibility (progression amounts are defined in PROGRESSION_RULES.md) and reset to 6–8 reps.
- RIR 1–2 corresponds to RPE 8–9.
- For a new lift with no history, the user must select a weight they can perform for 6 reps with good form.
