# Lift Targets

- Use 3 working sets per lift unless stated otherwise.
- Use a rep range of 6–12 reps for each working set.
- Select a starting weight you can lift for 6 reps with 2–3 reps in reserve (RIR).
- Target 12 reps on the first set and accept no fewer than 10 reps on the last set; increase weight only when both are achieved with 1–2 RIR.
- Once all 3 sets reach 12 reps with 1–2 RIR, increase weight by the smallest available increment and reset to 6–8 reps.
- If a set falls below 6 reps, reduce weight by one increment next session.
